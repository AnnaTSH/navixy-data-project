4. Working with ETL steps based on API queries.
Task: You work for a company that manages a vehicle fleet. You have a real-time monitoring system with detailed analysis of objects and their statuses. You need to organize a separate online dashboard, which will be available on a separate WEB resource. This dashboard should show summary information (current status) on vehicles in the fleet (for example, how many objects are in motion, how many are parked, and so on). Vehicle statuses and data can be collected using the get_states API call, connecting to https://api.eu.navixy.com/v2 using the key “feed00000000000000000000000cafe”.
You need to:
Create a dashboard for any BI tool (Power BI, SuperSet, Metabase, etc.) with significant information that will be useful to the fleet manager. So that the created dashboard is located (embedded) on a separate WEB resource.
